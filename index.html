    <h1>How TO Make Sandwich</h1>
    <br>
    <h2><strong>1.Spread Out</strong></h2>
    <h2>Sandwich spreads add flavor but also perform the essential task of lending moisture and sometimes creaminess to sandwiches. 
        Mustard and mayo are the familiar standbys, but don’t stop there. It’s well worth experimenting with the following: vinaigrettes,
         pestos, BBQ sauces, chutneys, and salsas.</h2>

    <h3><strong>2.Use the right bread</strong></h3>
    <h3>Choose bread appropriate to the sandwich you’re making.
         Pair moist fillings with soft, fluffy breads and you’ve got a recipe for a sponge,
          not a sandwich. As a general rule, the moister the filling the drier and denser 
          the bread should be. A good, thick crust helps, too. Swap in large flour tortillas, 
          if you like, for moist fillings. They keep ingredients in check and maintain their integrity 
          much better than many breads.
        </h3>
