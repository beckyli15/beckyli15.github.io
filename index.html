    <h1>How To Make Sandwich</h1>
    <h2><strong>1.Spread Out</strong></h2>
    <p>Sandwich spreads add flavor but also perform the essential task of lending moisture and sometimes creaminess to sandwiches. 
        Mustard and mayo are the familiar standbys, but don’t stop there. It’s well worth experimenting with the following: vinaigrettes,
         pestos, BBQ sauces, chutneys, and salsas.</p>
    <h3><strong>2.Use the right bread</strong></h3>
    <p>Choose bread appropriate to the sandwich you’re making.
         Pair moist fillings with soft, fluffy breads and you’ve got a recipe for a sponge,
          not a sandwich. As a general rule, the moister the filling the drier and denser 
          the bread should be. A good, thick crust helps, too. Swap in large flour tortillas, 
          if you like, for moist fillings. They keep ingredients in check and maintain their integrity 
          much better than many breads.
        </p>
    <h3><strong>3.Choosing togo toppings</strong></h3>
    <p>We love lettuce and tomato in sandwiches. They lend moisture, crunch and 
        freshness and provide a wonderful foil for heavy, rich ingredients. 
        They are, however, almost entirely water, and thus over extended periods are prone to wilting and, 
        worse, making bread soggy. Luckily there are plenty of vegetables that offer all the benefits of 
        lettuce and tomato without the drawbacks. In place of sliced tomatoes, for instance, try giving roasted 
        peppers. (It helps if you first blot the peppers dry with a paper towel). Instead of lettuce, experiment
         with other vegetables, like sliced fennel, spinach, shredded cabbage, or cucumber.
        </p>
    <h3><strong>4.</strong></h3>
    <p>Spread mayo, butter or cream cheese all the way to the edges of each slice of bread to create a seal 
        against wet sandwich fillings. Also, try packing high moisture ingredients, like tomatoes, pickles, 
        and cucumbers, separately. Just add them to the sandwich when you’re ready to eat. Toasting the bread 
        can help, too.</p>
    <h3><strong>5.</strong></h3>
    <p>Onions can give sandwiches a welcome bite but often must be tamed a bit to be enjoyed raw. There are two 
        effective ways to take some of the edge off sliced onions: Either soak thinly sliced onions in ice water 
        for 20 minutes or so. Then drain and blot dry. (This method adds crispness.) Or toss sliced onions with a 
        generous sprinkling of kosher salt. Wait a few minutes. Rub salt into the onions, rinse, drain.</p>
